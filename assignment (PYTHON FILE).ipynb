People are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. Thus, it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. The phrase \\u201cOut of sight, out of mind\\u201d has never been so apt than in today\\u2019s time. Social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. It\\u2019s why we call it \\u201csocial\\u201d media.Social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. Where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read, click on, and share your message?In practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers. Hence, when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand\\u2019s engagement tactics.A fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. The touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:\\u00a0AwarenessConsideration\\u00a0DecisionPurchase\\u00a0Post-purchase\\u00a0Touchpoints\\u00a0Word of mouth, social media, regular advertisements on the customer journey map\\u00a0Congruence with perceived and offered benefits, cost-benefit analysis, value propositionPlace and time utility, loyalty towards product, switching costs\\u00a0Retail/on-portal conversion levers, customer schemes\\u00a0Dissonance, purchase complexity\\u00a0To understand the reach of social media by the use of numbersMost popular social networks worldwide as of July 2020, ranked by number of active users (in millions)How many retweets on Twitter? How many reactions to the post on Facebook? How many likes on Instagram? How many shares on Linked In? This seems to be the new age Resume.Thus, a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. As with most online actions, it\\u2019s often difficult to measure offline benefits. More often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day/week, but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. That familiarity, later on, might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. Social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand\\u2019s personality, improves visibility, and becomes its voice.Customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. It could range from picking and variety-seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. Top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. No one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. Each brand\\u2019s strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell, its target customers, and the beliefs of the brand.Some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are:Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. Here the audience doesn\\u2019t care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers.An influencer as being someone who has:The power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their knowledge, position, authority, or relationship with their audience.a following in a distinct niche, with whom they regularly engage. The size of the following depends on the size of their topic of the niche.2017 saw Chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. Since then, it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio, while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers, especially on Instagram.\\u00a0Cross-Channel MarketingCross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. Because not everyone uses every single platform, it\\u2019s a good idea to have a presence on a few, and share some of the same content across the different networks. What makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. Apart from using basics like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter a clever use of Spotify, YouTube, or IGTV to showcase the brand can make a real difference.The luxury vehicle brand, Land Rover\\u2019s cross-channel marketing includes the Google Display Network, homepage masthead and Masthead in Lightbox ads on YouTube, and visibility through mobile, search, and Google+. The brand\\u2019s digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like Glacier National Park and the Appalachian Mountains and Land Rover\\u2019s microsite. Their cross-channel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from YouTube, and a 10% increase in search ad CTR. Further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15% of the brand\\u2019s total sales.InformativeThe content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. The brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products, new products, achievements of the brands, or even casual content. There should be \\u201cWow, I didn\\u2019t know this\\u201d factor. Only then will they become regular followers of the brand.An example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials. Fenty Beauty is one such prime example, which has built up to 1.4m followers within just 4 days of its launch, eventually garnering close to 10m followers, with Rihanna being one of their icons.Involving customers & engaging them:\\u201cCustomer is King\\u201d is a known concept. It is the foundation of traditional marketing. So while we shift to Social platforms brands must not forget them. Understanding their needs, addressing them, inviting them to respond and take part in the brand\\u2019s online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key.Founder and CEO of Glossier, Emily Weiss, described the brand as, \\u201cthe first socially-driven beauty brand.\\u201d Glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term \\u2018Instagram brands\\u2019 \\u2013 using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. Glossier often crowdsources product development, asking its Instagram followers what they\\u2019d like to see next.\\u00a0DynamicThe content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season, festival, or event that is happening. People must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it.Starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. Their one-off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver IPA Effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018. The launch of its now iconic \\u2018Unicorn Frappuccino\\u2019, spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating \\u2018Instagrammable\\u2019 food and drink. As\\u00a0a result, there are now 557,232 posts using the hashtag #PumpkinSpiceLatte.Product focussedNow of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. So it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. In simple terms, the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell.To support the product-centric statement, Oreo is the best example. Oreo\\u2019s social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. Completely product-focused and yet always creative, the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. The \\u2018Daily Twist\\u2019 campaign to mark its 100th birthday, saw the brand turn its Oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days, including Elvis Presley, a baseball, and a rainbow flag in support of Pride.\\u00a0Visuals\\u201cA picture is worth 1,000 words\\u201d. This adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media.\\u00a0 This is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. You can talk about a product all day, but until you\\u2019re able to put it in front of someone\\u2019s eyes, it\\u2019s not going to have nearly the same effect. Visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types- comics, memes, infographics, photos, videos and visual note-taking.Coca-Cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. The 2020 initiative video paved the way for multiway communication, as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent.\\u00a0Product demonstration:The barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. Customers often complain that till they don\\u2019t touch, try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. This can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. Hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium.Product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of AR technology, giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. Gucci partnered with Snapchat for the first global branded AR shoe try on the lens, hugely increasing fanfare!Social messageCorporate Social Responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. If a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. Creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. If a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it.Dove\\u2019s steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing that\\u2019s more than just marketing. The \\u2018Real Beauty\\u2019 campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 2004. Dove\\u2019s latest campaign once again highlighted the core message, going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. The \\u2018Courage is Beautiful\\u2019 campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the 2020 pandemic.The fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. Social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. Finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. Newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. At the end of the day, \\u2018customer is indeed king\\u2019. And companies would do well to remember it!\\u00a0Blackcoffer Insights 19: Debmalya Banik Chowdhury(XLRI Jamshedpur)& Tanisha Gupta(XLRI Delhi)\",\n          \"We have seen a huge development and dependence of people on technology in recent years. We have also seen the development of AI and ChatGPT in recent years. So it is a normal thing that we will become fully dependent on technology by 2040. Information technology will be a major power for all the developing nations. As a member of a developing nation, India is rapidly growing its IT base. It has also grown some IT cities which will be the major control centres for Information technology by 2040.Rising IT citiesNoida:- Noida in Uttar Pradesh near New Delhi is an emerging IT sector now. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Noida has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy. The establishment of so many software companies has made Noida an information technology hub.Gurgaon:- Gurgaon in Haryana is also an emerging IT hub. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Gurgaon has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Bengaluru:- Bengaluru is called as the IT hub of India. It is also a smart city. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Bengaluru has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Kolkata:- Kolkata in West Bengal is an emerging major IT hub. The new Kolkata i.e. Saltlake Sector\\u00a0 5, New town, Rajarhat area of Kolkata is a major IT hub. The government is giving the software companies land at almost free of cost to set up the companies there. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Kolkata has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Impact on EconomyThere is a huge impact of the rising IT cities on our economy. Some of the effects are-Demand:- The rising IT cities will greatly help to boost our economy. These will create a huge demand for raw materials. The products when ready will be a huge demand for the people too.Supply:-\\u2013 Supply means the fulfilment of demand. In a large and highly populous country like India, there is always a demand for finished products. If more IT cities do not develop, the companies cannot fulfil the needs and desires of the people of a populous country like India. As IT cities develop, more IT companies will come, which will supply more and more finished IT products to our people.Market: A market is a place where different economic agents like buyers and sellers interact with one another. In a populous country like India, there is a huge market. As IT cities will grow, more and more IT companies will come from across the world and more will the competition in the market increase. This will help consumers as they will get more and more differentiated products and the market will also run smoothly. A competitive market is always good and healthy. We can safely assume that our oligopoly market will surely tend to reach a perfectly competitive market by the year 2040.Revenue:- As the market increases, more revenue will be generated. Now at present, the IT revenue of India is 245 million dollars, 19 million dollars more than the financial year 2022. If IT cities grow, then more companies will invest which leads to an increase in the IT market which in turn generates more revenue in India. We can expect that the IT revenue of India will cross or nearly tend to reach 10 billion dollars by 2040.Impact on EnvironmentThe rising IT cities will create a huge impact on the environment, the maximum of which will be harmful effects. The impact of rising IT cities on the environment is-Deforestation:- There will be cutting of trees in huge numbers to make the building of the IT companies which will cause great harm to the environment. The cutting of trees on a large scale will also cause mass degradation of forests.More carbon footprint:- The IT companies will generate more carbon footprint in the atmosphere. South Asian countries including India are known for their lower carbon footprint. But if the IT sector grows this way then we will also be at the same pace of generation of carbon footprint by 2040.Death of birds:- The cell phone and mobile towers by the telecom companies caused the death of birds which caused a great imbalance in the ecosystem. The number of sparrows has been reduced due to this phenomenon. If this goes on we can see the extinction of many bird species by 2040.Impact on infrastructureThere are many contributions of the IT cities on infrastructure.\\u00a0 They are-Transportation:- The rising IT cities need an excellent transport system for the supply of raw materials and delivery of the finished products into the market. So the transportation system develops in that area. So we have an excellent transport system by 2040.Need for a public transport system:- There is a need for a public transport system in the IT cities. As the IT cities are a source of employment and a huge population reside in these areas, there is an adequate need for public transport systems like buses, taxis etc. We hope that it will be improved by 2040.Water supply:- As a huge number of people reside in the IT cities there is a need for adequate water supply to fulfil the needs of people as well as for industries. This will help us to find many new methods of water supply and conservation by 2040.Electricity:- Electric supply is the lifeline of the sector. Without an electric supply, no machines will run and not even the IT cities will flourish. If the IT cities flourish this way, we going to have an excellent electric supply by 2040.Healthcare:- As a large number of people reside in IT cities, there is a need for proper health infrastructure and healthcare facilities for the people. So with the growth of IT cities, our healthcare system will also improve by 2040.Education:- Education is the primary key or core of any nation. There must be proper education and training centres in those IT cities to fulfil the people\\u2019s demands.\\u00a0 So with the growth of IT cities, the education system will also develop by 2040. Our education is also going to be skill-oriented.Impact on city lifeWith the growth of IT cities, more people will get jobs and will earn more. So the purchasing power of the people will increase. People will lead a better lifestyle. They will buy things of good brand value. The tastes and preferences of people will also change. The human development index is going to increase. People will buy good quality food and good quality cars. So the food, automobile and many other industries are going to increase. So there will be a huge impact on city life by 2040.Blackcoffer Insights 47: Arka Mukhopadhyay, West Bengal University Of Animal And Fishery Sciences \",\n          \"IntroductionAI is rapidly evolving in the employment sector, particularly in matters involving business and finance. Finance, management, economics, and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally; particularly at the graduate level, due to their high employability. However, the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. According to research, 230,000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by AI agents in the next 5 years. This is due to the nature of the work, as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at. Large, complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by AI-powered computers than by people. Algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. In such matters involving industrial work, a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely, machine learning.Machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in systems, which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. It is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs.\\u00a0Its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data. This data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an IoT structure. The second and most time-consuming step is cleaning, preparing, and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers, trends, and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. The third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. Step four is where AI comes into place. Self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. The data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. Lastly, the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysis.There are three types of machine learning; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data. The machine is given a collection of information, including the outcome of the operation. The rest of the information is referred to as \\u2018input features\\u2019, which \\u2018supervises\\u2019 the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants.In the case of unsupervised learning, the machine isn\\u2019t given labeled sets of data to be divided into, allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. Since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities, this method helps with the classifying of such data.Reinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning. Similar to people, they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions.These variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance, which is elaborated on in the following passages.Machine learning in finance and bankingThere are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. The most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. Fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. The most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger, document forgery, and mortgage fraud.Usually, finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online, and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. With expanding innovative headway, misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. Fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules, which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. Therefore, most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions.\\u00a0Machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. It works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses \\u2013 like the client\\u2019s record history, IP address, area, and so forth.\\u00a0 Depending on the type of exchange taking place, the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision.Examples of fraud detection software used by banks include Feedzai, Data visor, and TeradataMachine learning is also used in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan underwriting, chatbots, and improving customer service.Algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value, timing, and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run.In contrast to human dealers, algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. Machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices, which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. Likewise, algorithmic exchanging doesn\\u2019t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings, which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. The exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities.In the banking industry, organizations access a large number of shopper information, with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. Machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring, and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people.Data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records, search for interesting special cases, and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. For instance, the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information, like age, pay, occupation, and the buyer\\u2019s credit conduct.The benefits of machine learningAs with any form of revolutionary technology, the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. It\\u2019s been observed that upon correct usage, it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. We\\u2019ve also seen several of the largest IT conglomerates, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, introduce Cloud Machine Learning platforms.Technology vs Human intelligenceIn terms of business, ML can aid businesses by identifying consumer\\u2019s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. It eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms.\\u00a0 Historical data, a process visualization tool, a flexible analytical environment, and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ML architecture. The input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present, which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. This eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks.In the financial sector, machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, loan underwriting, and fraud detection. Chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security, customer support, and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ML in banking. Another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition, which entails a system or program that recognizes objects, people, places, and movements in photos. It identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms.The downfalls of machine learningWith all the benefits of its advancement, machine learning isn\\u2019t the most perfect thing. There are several disadvantages which are information acquisition, time and resources and high errors, and wrong interpretations. One of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. More issues have to do with the fact that AI requires gigantic informational indexes to train on, and these ought to be unbiased, and of good quality. There can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. Machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. It also needs huge resources to work. This can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. Another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. You should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results.ConclusionThere have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. With excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. In countries like Japan, mainly computer programs and AI is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. From cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by AI. However, AI cannot replace humans in the future. Humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. These capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. For example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. A machine\\u2019s touch would not be able to soothe a child. Another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. Like computers, AI will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. Without humans themselves, there is no future for AI.Blackcoffer Insights 29: Amara Arora and Vaanya Kaushal, Scottish High International School\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

People are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. Thus, it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. The phrase \\u201cOut of sight, out of mind\\u201d has never been so apt than in today\\u2019s time. Social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. It\\u2019s why we call it \\u201csocial\\u201d media.Social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. Where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read, click on, and share your message?In practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers. Hence, when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand\\u2019s engagement tactics.A fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. The touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:\\u00a0AwarenessConsideration\\u00a0DecisionPurchase\\u00a0Post-purchase\\u00a0Touchpoints\\u00a0Word of mouth, social media, regular advertisements on the customer journey map\\u00a0Congruence with perceived and offered benefits, cost-benefit analysis, value propositionPlace and time utility, loyalty towards product, switching costs\\u00a0Retail/on-portal conversion levers, customer schemes\\u00a0Dissonance, purchase complexity\\u00a0To understand the reach of social media by the use of numbersMost popular social networks worldwide as of July 2020, ranked by number of active users (in millions)How many retweets on Twitter? How many reactions to the post on Facebook? How many likes on Instagram? How many shares on Linked In? This seems to be the new age Resume.Thus, a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. As with most online actions, it\\u2019s often difficult to measure offline benefits. More often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day/week, but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. That familiarity, later on, might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. Social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand\\u2019s personality, improves visibility, and becomes its voice.Customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. It could range from picking and variety-seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. Top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. No one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. Each brand\\u2019s strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell, its target customers, and the beliefs of the brand.Some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are:Influencer MarketingInfluencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. Here the audience doesn\\u2019t care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers.An influencer as being someone who has:The power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their knowledge, position, authority, or relationship with their audience.a following in a distinct niche, with whom they regularly engage. The size of the following depends on the size of their topic of the niche.2017 saw Chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. Since then, it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio, while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers, especially on Instagram.\\u00a0Cross-Channel MarketingCross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. Because not everyone uses every single platform, it\\u2019s a good idea to have a presence on a few, and share some of the same content across the different networks. What makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. Apart from using basics like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter a clever use of Spotify, YouTube, or IGTV to showcase the brand can make a real difference.The luxury vehicle brand, Land Rover\\u2019s cross-channel marketing includes the Google Display Network, homepage masthead and Masthead in Lightbox ads on YouTube, and visibility through mobile, search, and Google+. The brand\\u2019s digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like Glacier National Park and the Appalachian Mountains and Land Rover\\u2019s microsite. Their cross-channel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from YouTube, and a 10% increase in search ad CTR. Further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15% of the brand\\u2019s total sales.InformativeThe content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. The brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products, new products, achievements of the brands, or even casual content. There should be \\u201cWow, I didn\\u2019t know this\\u201d factor. Only then will they become regular followers of the brand.An example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials. Fenty Beauty is one such prime example, which has built up to 1.4m followers within just 4 days of its launch, eventually garnering close to 10m followers, with Rihanna being one of their icons.Involving customers & engaging them:\\u201cCustomer is King\\u201d is a known concept. It is the foundation of traditional marketing. So while we shift to Social platforms brands must not forget them. Understanding their needs, addressing them, inviting them to respond and take part in the brand\\u2019s online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key.Founder and CEO of Glossier, Emily Weiss, described the brand as, \\u201cthe first socially-driven beauty brand.\\u201d Glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term \\u2018Instagram brands\\u2019 \\u2013 using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. Glossier often crowdsources product development, asking its Instagram followers what they\\u2019d like to see next.\\u00a0DynamicThe content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season, festival, or event that is happening. People must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it.Starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. Their one-off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver IPA Effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018. The launch of its now iconic \\u2018Unicorn Frappuccino\\u2019, spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating \\u2018Instagrammable\\u2019 food and drink. As\\u00a0a result, there are now 557,232 posts using the hashtag #PumpkinSpiceLatte.Product focussedNow of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. So it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. In simple terms, the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell.To support the product-centric statement, Oreo is the best example. Oreo\\u2019s social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. Completely product-focused and yet always creative, the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. The \\u2018Daily Twist\\u2019 campaign to mark its 100th birthday, saw the brand turn its Oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days, including Elvis Presley, a baseball, and a rainbow flag in support of Pride.\\u00a0Visuals\\u201cA picture is worth 1,000 words\\u201d. This adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media.\\u00a0 This is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. You can talk about a product all day, but until you\\u2019re able to put it in front of someone\\u2019s eyes, it\\u2019s not going to have nearly the same effect. Visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types- comics, memes, infographics, photos, videos and visual note-taking.Coca-Cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. The 2020 initiative video paved the way for multiway communication, as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent.\\u00a0Product demonstration:The barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. Customers often complain that till they don\\u2019t touch, try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. This can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. Hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium.Product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of AR technology, giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. Gucci partnered with Snapchat for the first global branded AR shoe try on the lens, hugely increasing fanfare!Social messageCorporate Social Responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. If a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. Creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. If a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it.Dove\\u2019s steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing that\\u2019s more than just marketing. The \\u2018Real Beauty\\u2019 campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 2004. Dove\\u2019s latest campaign once again highlighted the core message, going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. The \\u2018Courage is Beautiful\\u2019 campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the 2020 pandemic.The fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. Social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. Finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. Newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. At the end of the day, \\u2018customer is indeed king\\u2019. And companies would do well to remember it!\\u00a0Blackcoffer Insights 19: Debmalya Banik Chowdhury(XLRI Jamshedpur)& Tanisha Gupta(XLRI Delhi)\",\n          \"We have seen a huge development and dependence of people on technology in recent years. We have also seen the development of AI and ChatGPT in recent years. So it is a normal thing that we will become fully dependent on technology by 2040. Information technology will be a major power for all the developing nations. As a member of a developing nation, India is rapidly growing its IT base. It has also grown some IT cities which will be the major control centres for Information technology by 2040.Rising IT citiesNoida:- Noida in Uttar Pradesh near New Delhi is an emerging IT sector now. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Noida has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy. The establishment of so many software companies has made Noida an information technology hub.Gurgaon:- Gurgaon in Haryana is also an emerging IT hub. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Gurgaon has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Bengaluru:- Bengaluru is called as the IT hub of India. It is also a smart city. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Bengaluru has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Kolkata:- Kolkata in West Bengal is an emerging major IT hub. The new Kolkata i.e. Saltlake Sector\\u00a0 5, New town, Rajarhat area of Kolkata is a major IT hub. The government is giving the software companies land at almost free of cost to set up the companies there. Many large companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Infosys and others have set up their companies here. Kolkata has a market base of billions of dollars and is doing a great job of boosting the national economy.Impact on EconomyThere is a huge impact of the rising IT cities on our economy. Some of the effects are-Demand:- The rising IT cities will greatly help to boost our economy. These will create a huge demand for raw materials. The products when ready will be a huge demand for the people too.Supply:-\\u2013 Supply means the fulfilment of demand. In a large and highly populous country like India, there is always a demand for finished products. If more IT cities do not develop, the companies cannot fulfil the needs and desires of the people of a populous country like India. As IT cities develop, more IT companies will come, which will supply more and more finished IT products to our people.Market: A market is a place where different economic agents like buyers and sellers interact with one another. In a populous country like India, there is a huge market. As IT cities will grow, more and more IT companies will come from across the world and more will the competition in the market increase. This will help consumers as they will get more and more differentiated products and the market will also run smoothly. A competitive market is always good and healthy. We can safely assume that our oligopoly market will surely tend to reach a perfectly competitive market by the year 2040.Revenue:- As the market increases, more revenue will be generated. Now at present, the IT revenue of India is 245 million dollars, 19 million dollars more than the financial year 2022. If IT cities grow, then more companies will invest which leads to an increase in the IT market which in turn generates more revenue in India. We can expect that the IT revenue of India will cross or nearly tend to reach 10 billion dollars by 2040.Impact on EnvironmentThe rising IT cities will create a huge impact on the environment, the maximum of which will be harmful effects. The impact of rising IT cities on the environment is-Deforestation:- There will be cutting of trees in huge numbers to make the building of the IT companies which will cause great harm to the environment. The cutting of trees on a large scale will also cause mass degradation of forests.More carbon footprint:- The IT companies will generate more carbon footprint in the atmosphere. South Asian countries including India are known for their lower carbon footprint. But if the IT sector grows this way then we will also be at the same pace of generation of carbon footprint by 2040.Death of birds:- The cell phone and mobile towers by the telecom companies caused the death of birds which caused a great imbalance in the ecosystem. The number of sparrows has been reduced due to this phenomenon. If this goes on we can see the extinction of many bird species by 2040.Impact on infrastructureThere are many contributions of the IT cities on infrastructure.\\u00a0 They are-Transportation:- The rising IT cities need an excellent transport system for the supply of raw materials and delivery of the finished products into the market. So the transportation system develops in that area. So we have an excellent transport system by 2040.Need for a public transport system:- There is a need for a public transport system in the IT cities. As the IT cities are a source of employment and a huge population reside in these areas, there is an adequate need for public transport systems like buses, taxis etc. We hope that it will be improved by 2040.Water supply:- As a huge number of people reside in the IT cities there is a need for adequate water supply to fulfil the needs of people as well as for industries. This will help us to find many new methods of water supply and conservation by 2040.Electricity:- Electric supply is the lifeline of the sector. Without an electric supply, no machines will run and not even the IT cities will flourish. If the IT cities flourish this way, we going to have an excellent electric supply by 2040.Healthcare:- As a large number of people reside in IT cities, there is a need for proper health infrastructure and healthcare facilities for the people. So with the growth of IT cities, our healthcare system will also improve by 2040.Education:- Education is the primary key or core of any nation. There must be proper education and training centres in those IT cities to fulfil the people\\u2019s demands.\\u00a0 So with the growth of IT cities, the education system will also develop by 2040. Our education is also going to be skill-oriented.Impact on city lifeWith the growth of IT cities, more people will get jobs and will earn more. So the purchasing power of the people will increase. People will lead a better lifestyle. They will buy things of good brand value. The tastes and preferences of people will also change. The human development index is going to increase. People will buy good quality food and good quality cars. So the food, automobile and many other industries are going to increase. So there will be a huge impact on city life by 2040.Blackcoffer Insights 47: Arka Mukhopadhyay, West Bengal University Of Animal And Fishery Sciences \",\n          \"IntroductionAI is rapidly evolving in the employment sector, particularly in matters involving business and finance. Finance, management, economics, and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally; particularly at the graduate level, due to their high employability. However, the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. According to research, 230,000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by AI agents in the next 5 years. This is due to the nature of the work, as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at. Large, complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by AI-powered computers than by people. Algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. In such matters involving industrial work, a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely, machine learning.Machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in systems, which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. It is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs.\\u00a0Its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data. This data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an IoT structure. The second and most time-consuming step is cleaning, preparing, and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers, trends, and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. The third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. Step four is where AI comes into place. Self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. The data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. Lastly, the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysis.There are three types of machine learning; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data. The machine is given a collection of information, including the outcome of the operation. The rest of the information is referred to as \\u2018input features\\u2019, which \\u2018supervises\\u2019 the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants.In the case of unsupervised learning, the machine isn\\u2019t given labeled sets of data to be divided into, allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. Since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities, this method helps with the classifying of such data.Reinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning. Similar to people, they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions.These variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance, which is elaborated on in the following passages.Machine learning in finance and bankingThere are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. The most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. Fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. The most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger, document forgery, and mortgage fraud.Usually, finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online, and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. With expanding innovative headway, misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. Fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules, which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. Therefore, most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions.\\u00a0Machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. It works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses \\u2013 like the client\\u2019s record history, IP address, area, and so forth.\\u00a0 Depending on the type of exchange taking place, the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision.Examples of fraud detection software used by banks include Feedzai, Data visor, and TeradataMachine learning is also used in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan underwriting, chatbots, and improving customer service.Algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value, timing, and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run.In contrast to human dealers, algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. Machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices, which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. Likewise, algorithmic exchanging doesn\\u2019t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings, which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. The exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities.In the banking industry, organizations access a large number of shopper information, with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. Machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring, and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people.Data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records, search for interesting special cases, and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. For instance, the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information, like age, pay, occupation, and the buyer\\u2019s credit conduct.The benefits of machine learningAs with any form of revolutionary technology, the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. It\\u2019s been observed that upon correct usage, it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. We\\u2019ve also seen several of the largest IT conglomerates, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, introduce Cloud Machine Learning platforms.Technology vs Human intelligenceIn terms of business, ML can aid businesses by identifying consumer\\u2019s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. It eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms.\\u00a0 Historical data, a process visualization tool, a flexible analytical environment, and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ML architecture. The input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present, which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. This eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks.In the financial sector, machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, loan underwriting, and fraud detection. Chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security, customer support, and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ML in banking. Another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition, which entails a system or program that recognizes objects, people, places, and movements in photos. It identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms.The downfalls of machine learningWith all the benefits of its advancement, machine learning isn\\u2019t the most perfect thing. There are several disadvantages which are information acquisition, time and resources and high errors, and wrong interpretations. One of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. More issues have to do with the fact that AI requires gigantic informational indexes to train on, and these ought to be unbiased, and of good quality. There can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. Machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. It also needs huge resources to work. This can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. Another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. You should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results.ConclusionThere have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. With excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. In countries like Japan, mainly computer programs and AI is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. From cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by AI. However, AI cannot replace humans in the future. Humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. These capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. For example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. A machine\\u2019s touch would not be able to soothe a child. Another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. Like computers, AI will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. Without humans themselves, there is no future for AI.Blackcoffer Insights 29: Amara Arora and Vaanya Kaushal, Scottish High International School\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

task such a data analysis and keeping track of numerical information which machine excel at large complicated data set can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by computer than by people algorithmic trading procedure that produce automated deal are le likely to be produced without minute error when undertaken by human in such matter involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used namely machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence ai in system which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer program it improvement process is mainly divided into seven step which start with the collection of data this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure the second and most step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data which involves the recognition of outlier trend and missing information so that the outcome is a accurate a possible the third step consists of formatting data which is useful if you source your information from a variety of source step four is where ai come into place data processing tool may be useful if they provide intelligent service for matching data attribute from distinct database and intelligently integrating them the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern lastly the data is divided into two set one for training the algorithm and one for are three type of machine learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning which is based on accurately labeled data the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation the rest of the information is referred to a input feature which supervises the machine by guiding it to establish the connection between the the case of unsupervised learning the machine isn t given labeled set of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create it own pattern within the information provided since computer have the capability of identifying distinguished similarity this method help with the classifying of such learning comprises learning similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their variation of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following learning in finance and bankingthere are many way in which machine learning is used in finance and banking the most common place it is used is to detect any fraud fraud is the most common problem in financial service company and it account for billion of dollar in misfortune each year the most common fraud are

learning isn t the most perfect thing there are several disadvantage which are information acquisition time and resource and high error and wrong interpretation one of the major hurdle is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project more issue have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational index to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality there can likewise be time where they have to wait for that new information to be produced machine learning need sufficient opportunity to do the calculation to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy it also need huge resource to work this can mean extra requirement for the computer to work another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the result produced by the calculation you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithm to get the wanted have been various report in the past and current year which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robot and machine in the year to come with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous position are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machine in country like japan mainly computer program and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sector from cleaning the house to depositing money in bank everything is done by ai however ai can not replace human in the future human have several capability which even after several technological advancement a machine would not be able to have these capability include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection for example when a child go to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle a machine s touch would not be able to soothe a child another example could be how human tend to share thing with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to thing it ha been told to do like computer ai will not replace u but would however complement u
